Design Patterns in Dart
=======================

This project is dead. [Or is it?](https://www.compendiousthunks.com)

This is the public facing code repository for [Design Patterns in Dart](http://designpatternsindart.com). The code here is _unfinished_, intended as background research for the eventual code that will be included in the book.

To receive updates, get access to the real code, the book source, and the finished productâ€¦

Learn Dart, Design Patterns and how to love again.
